# Section 1: Intro Project Analysis and Context

## 1.1 Existing Project Overview

### Analysis Source
- IDE-based fresh analysis
- Project Brief available at: docs/brief.md

### Current Project State
KokoroJS is currently a standalone web application that provides high-quality text-to-speech functionality using the Kokoro-82M ONNX model. The project runs entirely client-side with no external API dependencies after initial model download, implementing privacy-first TTS with multiple natural voices and semantic text splitting capabilities.

## 1.2 Available Documentation Analysis

### Available Documentation
✓ Project Brief (comprehensive)
✗ Tech Stack Documentation
✗ Source Tree/Architecture
✗ Coding Standards
✗ API Documentation
✗ External API Documentation
✗ UX/UI Guidelines
✗ Technical Debt Documentation

**Recommendation:** While the project brief is comprehensive, technical documentation is lacking. However, the codebase appears straightforward enough to proceed with the enhancement planning.

## 1.3 Enhancement Scope Definition

### Enhancement Type
Based on the project brief's "Next Steps" section, this appears to be:
✓ **New Feature Addition** - Converting standalone web app to Chrome Extension
✓ **Integration with New Systems** - Chrome Extension APIs
✓ **Technology Stack Upgrade** - Manifest V3 architecture

### Enhancement Description
Convert the existing KokoroJS web application into a fully-functional Chrome Extension that provides text-to-speech functionality for any selected text on any webpage, maintaining the privacy-first approach with complete offline operation after initial setup.

### Impact Assessment
✓ **Major Impact (architectural changes required)** - The conversion from web app to extension requires fundamental restructuring including:
- Service Worker implementation for background processing
- Content Scripts for webpage interaction
- Offscreen API for audio handling
- Extension manifest configuration
- New UI patterns for extension interaction

## 1.4 Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable TTS functionality on any webpage through text selection
- Maintain 100% offline operation after model download
- Provide seamless integration via floating buttons and context menus
- Support 10,000+ active users within 6 months
- Achieve <3 second time-to-first-audio for average text selections
- Enable automatic reading of main page content without text selection

### Background Context
This enhancement transforms KokoroJS from a standalone web application into a browser extension, addressing the fragmentation problem where users must copy-paste text into separate applications. The extension will leverage Chrome's Offscreen API for proper audio handling and IndexedDB for model storage, bringing studio-quality TTS directly to users' browsing experience while maintaining complete privacy.
