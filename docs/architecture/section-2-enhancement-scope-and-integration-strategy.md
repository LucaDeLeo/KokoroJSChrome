# Section 2: Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

## Enhancement Overview
**Enhancement Type:** Platform Migration & Feature Addition
**Scope:** Complete transformation from web application to Chrome Extension with webpage TTS integration
**Integration Impact:** High - Fundamental architecture restructuring required

## Integration Approach

**Code Integration Strategy:** Modular extraction and transformation approach
- Preserve core TTS engine (kokoro.js, phonemize.js) without modification
- Transform worker.js → offscreen.js for background audio processing
- Adapt main.js → split between popup.js (UI) and content-script.js (webpage integration)
- Bundle all CDN dependencies locally for Manifest V3 compliance

**Database Integration:** Migration from localStorage to Chrome storage APIs
- IndexedDB for 300MB model storage (unchanged from web app)
- chrome.storage.sync for user preferences (10KB limit)
- chrome.storage.local for recent selections cache (10MB limit)

**API Integration:** Chrome Extension API adoption
- chrome.runtime for message passing between contexts
- chrome.offscreen for audio processing
- chrome.contextMenus for right-click integration
- chrome.tabs (activeTab permission only) for content injection

**UI Integration:** Shadow DOM based approach
- Floating button via Shadow DOM to avoid CSS conflicts
- Popup window for settings and manual text input
- Progress indicators preserved from existing updateProgress.js

## Compatibility Requirements

- **Existing API Compatibility:** TTS engine API signatures remain unchanged - kokoro.js methods work identically
- **Database Schema Compatibility:** Model storage format in IndexedDB remains identical for easy migration
- **UI/UX Consistency:** Voice selection, progress bars, and controls maintain current design language
- **Performance Impact:** <3 second time-to-first-audio maintained for selections under 1000 characters
