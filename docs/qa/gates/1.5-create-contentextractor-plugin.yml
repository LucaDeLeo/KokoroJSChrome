# Quality Gate Decision - Story 1.5

schema: 1
story: "1.5"
story_title: "Create ContentExtractor Plugin"
gate: "PASS"
status_reason: "Implementation meets all functional requirements with comprehensive test coverage (27/27 passing). Five issues systematically identified and resolved: XSS vulnerability fixed, memory handling optimized, tab ID architectural limitation resolved, TextCache auto-cleanup implemented (privacy requirement), and real-site testing documented. All acceptance criteria met, all IVs verified, all NFRs passing. Zero remaining blockers."

# NFR validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All security issues resolved. XSS vulnerability fixed (innerHTML → DOMParser). Shadow DOM properly isolated. New XSS security test added to prevent regression."
    issues_fixed:
      - "XSS risk in readability-wrapper.js:126 - replaced innerHTML with DOMParser"
      - "Added comprehensive XSS security test (test file lines 454-496)"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All timing requirements met: extraction <500ms (IV2), button render <200ms (IV4), selection debounce 200ms. TextCache cleanup runs every 10 minutes with minimal overhead."
    metrics:
      - "Simple extraction: <100ms measured"
      - "Advanced extraction: <500ms measured"
      - "Button render: <200ms measured"
      - "Cleanup interval: 10 minutes (efficient)"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent error handling with fallback mechanisms. Readability → simple mode fallback works correctly. CSP detection implemented. TextCache auto-cleanup prevents memory accumulation."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization, comprehensive JSDoc, clear separation of concerns, dependency injection pattern. All architectural limitations clearly documented."
  privacy:
    status: PASS
    notes: "TextCache auto-cleanup implemented per story line 391 requirement. Large texts (>50KB) automatically deleted after 1 hour. Privacy requirement fulfilled."
