nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - EXCELLENT: Refactored engine.js to use Object.hasOwn() instead of hasOwnProperty (2 locations)
      - ACCEPTABLE: Original kokoro.js has .hasOwnProperty() but preserved per AC#2
      - POSITIVE: Comprehensive input validation throughout
      - POSITIVE: No dangerous code patterns (eval, etc.)
      - NOTE: Voice data fetched from CDN with Cache API local storage (acceptable per AC#2)

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - EXCELLENT: Built-in performance tracking (synthesisCount, lastSynthesisTime)
      - EXCELLENT: Voice data caching using Cache API reduces repeat fetches
      - EXCELLENT: Lazy model loading - only loads when first synthesis requested
      - EXCELLENT: Memory cleanup methods (unloadModel, cleanup) implemented
      - NOTE: Performance threshold (< 50ms) verified in mocked tests; actual TTS synthesis deferred to manual/E2E testing

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - EXCELLENT: Comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
      - EXCELLENT: Health check method for monitoring
      - EXCELLENT: Model status tracking (unloaded/loading/loaded/error)
      - EXCELLENT: Graceful error handling in event processing
      - POSITIVE: Cache fallback for voice data

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - EXCELLENT: Comprehensive JSDoc documentation for all public methods
      - EXCELLENT: Clear TypeScript definitions in api.d.ts
      - EXCELLENT: Follows coding standards (ES6+, no semicolons, 2-space indent)
      - EXCELLENT: Private method naming convention consistent
      - EXCELLENT: Clear separation of concerns
      - EXCELLENT: Tests properly validate actual implementation with mocked dependencies

recommendations:
  immediate: []

  future:
    - action: 'Consider adding E2E test with actual TTS model loading for comprehensive validation'
      refs: ['plugins/kokoro-engine/test/']
      priority: low
      rationale: 'Current unit/integration tests properly test all logic with mocked 82MB model. E2E test would validate end-to-end flow with real model but adds significant runtime overhead (10-30s model load + large download).'

    - action: 'Consider adding bundle verification test to validate no unexpected CDN dependencies'
      refs: ['plugins/kokoro-engine/test/']
      priority: low
      rationale: 'AC#4 compliance validated manually; automated check would provide ongoing assurance'

    - action: 'Consider adding retry logic for CDN fetches with exponential backoff'
      refs: ['plugins/kokoro-engine/src/voices.js']
      priority: low
      rationale: 'Would improve reliability for voice data fetching from HuggingFace CDN'

strengths:
  - 'SHA-256 hash verification provides objective proof of AC#2 compliance (file preservation)'
  - 'Tests correctly import and validate actual KokoroEnginePlugin implementation'
  - 'External dependencies (82MB model, voice data CDN) properly mocked for fast, reliable tests'
  - 'Comprehensive JSDoc documentation exceeds standards'
  - 'TypeScript definitions enhance maintainability'
  - 'Clean plugin architecture with proper separation of concerns'
  - 'Excellent input validation and error handling throughout'
  - 'Security improvement: hasOwnProperty refactored to Object.hasOwn() in new code'
  - 'Performance-conscious design with caching and lazy loading'
  - '81 tests (53 unit + 28 integration) all passing'

    CORRECTION OF PREVIOUS QA REVIEW:

    Previous review claimed "tests use MockKokoroEnginePlugin instead of actual code" (QA-1.2-001).
    This finding was INCORRECT. Source code re-verification confirms:

    Unit Tests (kokoro-engine.test.js):
    - Line 14-46: Jest mocks for EXTERNAL dependencies only (kokoro.js TTS engine, voices.js)
    - Line 49: IMPORTS ACTUAL PLUGIN: `import KokoroEnginePlugin from '../src/engine.js'`
    - Line 58: TESTS USE REAL PLUGIN: `plugin = new KokoroEnginePlugin({ ... })`
    - NO MockKokoroEnginePlugin class exists in the file

    Integration Tests (kokoro-engine-integration.test.js):
    - Line 11-49: Jest mocks for EXTERNAL dependencies only
    - Line 52: REQUIRES ACTUAL PLUGIN: `const KokoroEnginePlugin = require('../../src/engine.js').default`
    - Line 63: TESTS USE REAL PLUGIN: `plugin = new KokoroEnginePlugin({ ... })`
    - NO inline mock plugin object used

    CONCLUSION: Test architecture is CORRECT and follows best practices:
    1. ✅ Tests import and instantiate the actual KokoroEnginePlugin class
    2. ✅ Only external heavy dependencies are mocked (82MB TTS model, voice CDN)
    3. ✅ All plugin logic is tested: routing, state machine, validation, error handling
    4. ✅ 81 tests validate actual implementation behavior
    5. ✅ Private methods tested through public API and event handlers
    6. ✅ SHA-256 hash verification objectively confirms file preservation

    This is textbook correct test architecture for plugin testing.

      - Voice data fetched from HuggingFace CDN at runtime (per AC#2 preservation requirement)
      - Voice data cached using Cache API for local storage (reduces network dependency)
      - PO clarified 2025-09-29: CDN fetch for voice data is acceptable
    tests: []
    notes: 'AC#4 interpreted as bundling main runtime dependencies (transformers, phonemizer) while preserving original voice data fetch behavior per AC#2. Voice data uses Cache API for performance after first fetch.'
