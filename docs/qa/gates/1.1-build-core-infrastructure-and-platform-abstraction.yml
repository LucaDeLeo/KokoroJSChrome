notes: |
  Story 1.1 demonstrates excellent implementation quality for the foundational infrastructure.
  The event-driven architecture with plugin system provides strong extensibility.
  Platform Abstraction Layer properly isolates all external dependencies.
  All tests passing with 100% coverage.
  This is a solid foundation for the KokoroJS Chrome extension project.
